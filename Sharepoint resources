One solution:  Have workflow create a hidden list when an infopath document is added.   Then use that list in the method we already have.

http://www.netwoven.com/2015/04/how-to-dynamically-create-and-populate-word-document-in-a-document-library-from-custom-list/

 

This is very possible using the following:

•A Document Content Type holding all the fields you want
to have appear in your document -"Observation_Summary_Report"

-Submitter name

-Report name

-Date

-suggestions/recommendations

•A Template library that holds your document template and
is using the above content type -Observation_Summary_Report •A second document
library that will have the above content type and has the template document
above as its document template (advanced settings under Document Library
Settings - Content Type Name) •A custom list that has the same fields as those
used in your content type.

•A SharePoint Designer workflow that will run on the
creation of an item in your custom list above.

 

Once you upload your template to the template library,
open the template from SharePoint and in Word (assuming 2013 but could be 2010
also) and go to Insert -> QuickParts -> Document Property. You should see
the other content type fields appear here. Add them to the document and save it
back to SharePoint when ready.

 

In the second document library add the same content type
and make sure that it's template refers to the template document you uploaded
above.

 

In SharePoint designer, create a workflow that will run
against the custom list you will create. The workflow only needs to do one
thing, create a new item in the secondary library above. 

 

In the workflow action, make sure you specify the correct
content type, and you map the fields from your custom list to the related
content type fields. Ensure the workflow will run on the creation of an item.

 

Then whenever a user adds an item to your custom list,
the workflow will fire and create a new document in your secondary document
library. It will also copy the custom item values that the user entered to the
secondary document library. 

 

When a user opens the new document it will pull those
values in as per your template.

 

I hope this helps, I know it is a bit convoluted but I
wanted to show you how you can do this more or less out of the box.
